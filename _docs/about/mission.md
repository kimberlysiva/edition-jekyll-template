Mixspace is our shorthand for mixed reality. We believe that in the near future the majority of our work and play will take place in mixspace, and our goal is to create tools to explore this space. How do we interact with it? How do we shape it to meet our varied needs? How do we find joy and freedom in this new environment? How can it bring people together, in work and play?

This is a new frontier and there is a lot of exploring to do. Join us as we discover what mixspace has to offer!
