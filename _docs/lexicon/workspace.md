The workspace asset is a collection of intents which define the Lexicon for a particular application.

This asset contains the Speech-to-Text and Conversation settings for the application. It provides the ability to sync both services with the cloud, and reports the training status. Developers can optionally create a custom language model for Speech-to-Text, which automatically gathers up all the intent phrases and entity values for training. The developer can view the out-of-vocabulary words and edit them as needed.

Note that the data sync is one-way, from the Unity editor to the Watson cloud.
